This is a sample C++ app to use on a [NumWorks calculator](https://www.numworks.com).

```cpp

using namespace EADK;

void eadk_main() {
  Display::pushRectUniform(
    Display::Rect(0, 0, 320, 240),
    Display::Color(0x000000)
  );
  while (1) {
    Keyboard::State kbd = Keyboard::scan();
    if (kbd.keyDown(Keyboard::Key::OK)) {
      spaceship.createRockets();
    }
    if (kbd.keyDown(Keyboard::Key::Up)) {
      spaceship.move(0, -Spaceship::k_step);
    }
    refreshScene();
  }
}
```

## Build the app

You need to install an embedded ARM toolchain and a couple Python modules.

```shell
brew install numworks/tap/arm-none-eabi-gcc # Or equivalent on your OS
pip3 install lz4 pypng
make clean && make build
```

Once you app 'target/voord.nwa' is built, you can upload it onto your calculator from [NumWorks online uploader](https://my.numworks.com/apps).

## Run the app (development)

The app is sent over to the calculator using the DFU protocol over USB.
The last command has to be executed with the targeted device plugged to the computer.

```shell
brew install dfu-util # Or equivalent on your OS
# Now connect your NumWorks calculator to your computer using the USB cable
make run
```

## Requirements of .nwa

### Symbols that the external app should define

The file .nwa expects the following symbols to be defined by the app:
- `eadk_app_name`: this is the address of the string representing the name of the app. It will be displayed in the Home of Epsilon
- `eadk_app_api_level`: this is a 4-byte integer stating which version of eadk/eadk.s the external app relies on.
- `eadk_app_icon`: this is the address of a char table of the icon pixels. This table can by generated by the [inliner.py](/eadk/inliner.py) script from a png file. The png file has to be 55x56 sized. The script converts the png into pixels and compress them using the LZ4 protocole.
- `_eadk_main` is the entry point of the application.

Optionally, if the external app needs abritary binary code, it can define the `eadk_external_data`. If so, the [NumWorks online uploader](https://my.numworks.com/apps) will ask for the external data to be provided after dropping the .nwa. (In development, you will need to modify `eadk-bin.ld` in order to link the `eadk_external_data`.)

### Symbols that can be used by the external app

Your application can use all symbols defined in [eadk.s](/eadk/eadk.s).

## Notes

The NumWorks calculator runs [Epsilon](http://github.com/numworks/epsilon), a tailor-made calculator operating system. Starting from version 16, Epsilon allows installing custom binary apps. To run this sample app, make sure your calculator is up-to-date by visiting <https://my.numworks.com>.

Epsilon expects apps to follow a certain layout in memory. Namely, they should start with the following header:

|Offset| Size | Value      | Description                  |
|------|------|------------|------------------------------|
| 0x00 | 0x04 | 0xDEC0BEBA | Magic start-of-header marker |
| 0x04 | 0x04 | 0x00000000 | API Level |
| 0x08 | 0x04 | -          | Offset from start of the app to a NULL-terminated NFKD UTF-8 string containing the app name |
| 0x0C | 0x04 | -          | Size of the icon data |
| 0x10 | 0x04 | -          | Offset from start of the app to the actual icon data. This data should be the result of LZ4-compressing a sequence of 55x56 RGB565 pixels |
| 0x14 | 0x04 | -          | Offset from start of the app to the entry point. |
| 0x18 | 0x04 | -          | Size of the entire app |
| 0x22 | 0x04 | 0xDEC0BEBA | Magic end-of-header marker |

Generating the appropriate header is taken care of by the [NumWorks online uploader](https://my.numworks.com/apps). In development, it'll be done by a [linker script](/eadk/eadk-bin.ld) when you run `make run`.

The information about where to link in flash and in RAM are dynamically extracted from headers provided by the calculator. The RAM is mapped from 0x2000 0000 and starts with the following header:

|Offset| Size | Value      | Description                  |
|------|------|------------|------------------------------|
| 0x00 | 0x04 | 0xEFEEDBBA | Magic start-of-header marker |
| 0x04 | 0x04 | -          | Pointer to kernel header |
| 0x08 | 0x04 | -          | Pointer to userland header |
| 0x0C | 0x04 | 0xEFEEDBBA | Magic end-of-header marker |

The userland header gives the following information useful to link the external application:

|Offset| Size | Value      | Description                  |
|------|------|------------|------------------------------|
| 0x00 | 0x04 | 0xDEC0EDFE | Magic start-of-header marker |
| 0x04 | 0x04 | -          | Version of epsilon that should be matched by kernel |
| 0x08 | 0x04 | -          | Storage address in RAM |
| 0x0C | 0x04 | -          | Storage size |
| 0x10 | 0x04 | -          | External applications start address in flash |
| 0x14 | 0x04 | -          | External applications end address in flash |
| 0x18 | 0x04 | -          | External applications start address in RAM |
| 0x1C | 0x04 | -          | External applications end address in RAM |
| 0x20 | 0x04 | 0xDEC0EDFE | Magic end-of-header marker |

In release, you only need the `voord.nwa` executable. The [NumWorks online uploader](https://my.numworks.com/apps) will handle for you the dynamic linking and the uploading process.

While you're developing your app, the dynamic linking process can be done by the [get_device_information.py](/eadk/get_device_information.py) script. Once the corresponding binary is built on your computer, you will need to install it in your calculator's Flash memory. The included [run.py](/eadk/run.py) script will take care of this for you when you call `make run`.

Due to the embedded nature of Epsilon, this C++ app is built using `-ffreestanding -nostdinc -nostdlib`. The interface that an app can use to interact with the OS is essentially a short list of system calls. Feel free to browse the [code of Epsilon](http://github.com/numworks/epsilon) itself if you want to get an in-depth look.

Please note that any custom app is removed when resetting the calculator.
